# key-value-store

Work in progress.

This spawned out of a desire to implement leader/follower replication in some way and ended up a legit attempt to build a key value store with some nice features.

## TODO

1. Finish tests for basic store functionality
2. Finish LRU and LFU caching algorithms
3. Add disk persistence
4. Add leader/follower replication.
5. Add clustering???
